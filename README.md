#Guide to set up the developing environment for the project

The following are the steps to set up your machine to run the project

   1. Create a virtual environment
   2. Install the dependencies in the environment.

#Create a virtual environment

Open your terminal or command prompt and create a folder or go to a directory you want to save the project using 'cd' command.

\```
cd path/to/your/directory
\```

install 'virtualenv' with this command
\```Windows
pip install virtualenv
\```

\```macOS, linux
pip3 install virtualenv
\```


Type the following to create a virtual environment. Replace 'myenv' with the name you want for your virtual environment.
\```Windows
python -m venv myenv
\```

\```macOS, linux
python3 -m venv myenv
\```


Type this to activate the environment. Don't forget to replace 'myenv' with your environment name.
\```WIndows
myenv\Scripts\activate
\```

\```macOS, linux
source myenv/bin/activate
\```


Now you're in the environment if the environment name appears inside a '()' at the front of your next line like the following.
\```
(myenv)path/to/your/directory
\```


if you are done working on the project and want to get out of the environment, deactivate it by typing
\```Windows, macOS, Linux
deactivate
\``` 




#Install the dependencies in the environment

The project uses Flask, a python web framework for the backend and pyFirmata, to communicate Python with the arduino. Both of the frameworks and the opencv-python library are included in the requirements.txt file. After activating the environment, to install, type the following command.(Do not install these without activating the environment first) 

\```Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

\```macOS, linux
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
\```

Once the installation process is complete, the set up is done.
